# CatChat_Mini_project

The application was written in Java.

In order to make the program work the attached zip file needs to be extracted on your PC. 
From there the folder called "Cat/Chat/mini/project/aau/med3" is the one containing the actual program. 
To open the program you need to go to src folder then to Cat/Chat/mini/project/aau/med3 folder. 
The folder needs to be imported to IntelLiJ IDEA software. The application was written mainly in IntelliJ IDEA and some of the parts were written in eclipse IDE. The project can be run in eclipse IDE too, with few adjustments, like dleting .idea folder.
 
In order to run the application the Server class needs to be run first and after that any Client class can be run. 
If the imported images do not work/load, the path to the image should be specified in the code into the code if the application is being opened in IntelLiJ IDEA. If project is being opened in eclipse IDE then the images have to be imported into the project.

The order in which clients are run does not matter. 
If all three clients are run, there should be three pop-up windows. 
In those windows any message can be typed and sent by pressing the send button. 
The sent message will appear on all the pop-up windows which creates a chat on the localhost.

If one of the clients is closed and rerun again, the server needs to be closed and the server needs to be rerun.

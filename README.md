# Cat-Chat
 
In order to run the application the `Server` class needs to be run first and after that any `Client` class can be run. 
If the imported images do not work/load, the path to the image should be specified in the code.

The order in which the clients are run does not matter. If all three clients are run, there should be three pop-up windows. In these windows any message can be typed and sent by pressing the send button. The sent message will appear on all the pop-up windows which creates a chat on the localhost.

# CatChat_Mini_project

In order to make the program work the attached zip file needs to be extracted on your PC.
From there the folder called "CatChat" is the one containing the actual program.
To open the program you need to go to src folder then to Cat.Chat.mini.project.aau.med3 folder.
The folder needs to be imported to any Java IDE software.
First to run is the Server class and after that any Client class can be run.
If the imported images do not work/ load, the path to the image should be inputted into the code. 

The order in which clients are run does not matter.
If all three clients are run, there should be three pop-up windows. 
In those windows any message can be typed and sent by pressing the send button. 
The sent message will appear on all the pop-up windows which creates a chat on the localhost. 

If we close one of the clients to rerun it the server need to be closed and the server needs to be run once again.
